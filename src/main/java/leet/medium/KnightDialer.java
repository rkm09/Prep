/*
The chess knight has a unique movement, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L).
We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight can only stand on a numeric cell.
Given an integer n, return how many distinct phone numbers of length n we can dial.
You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and then you should perform n - 1 jumps to dial a number of length n. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.
As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 1 | 2 | 3
 4 | 5 | 6
 7 | 8 | 9
 * | 0 | #
Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.
Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: All the valid number we can dial are [04, 06, 16, 18, 27, 29, 34, 38, 40, 43, 49, 60, 61, 67, 72, 76, 81, 83, 92, 94]
Example 3:
Input: n = 3131
Output: 136006598
Explanation: Please take care of the mod.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 5000

DP:
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n)
If k is the size of the phone pad, then there are O(nâ‹…k) states to our DP. Because k=10k = 10k=10 in this problem, we can treat k as a constant and thus there are O(n) states to our DP.
Due to memoization, we never calculate a state more than once. Since the number of nextSquare is no more than 3 for each square, calculating each state is done in O(1) as we simply perform a for loop that never iterates more than 3 times.
Overall, we calculate O(n) states with each state costing O(1) to calculate. Thus, our time complexity is O(n).
Space complexity: O(n)
The recursion call stack will grow to a size of O(n). With memoization, we also store the results to every DP state. As there are O(n) states, we require O(n) space to store all the results.
