/*
Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
Time: O(1)
The run time depends on the number of bits in n.
Because n in this piece of code is a 32-bit integer, the time complexity is O(1).
The space complexity is O(1), since no additional space is allocated.
